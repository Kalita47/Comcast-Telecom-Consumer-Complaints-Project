# Comcast-Telecom-Consumer-Complaints-Project
This is a Project on Telecom Customer Complaints in Python.Here, I performed insight analysis by various tasks that included a trend chart for the 
number of complaints at monthly and daily granularity levels. A table was prepared with the frequency of complaint types. A state wise status in a stacked 
bar chart was created and found out the states having maximum complaints and highest percentage of unresolved complaints.
